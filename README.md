# Vision Simulator

**Vision Simulator** is a custom NVIDIA Omniverse extension that provides real-time simulations of various visual impairments. It allows users to experience how individuals with colour vision deficiencies (such as Deuteranopia, Protanopia, and Tritanopia) perceive colours in their environment. This tool is ideal for evaluating design accessibility and inclusivity in digital and 3D spaces.
